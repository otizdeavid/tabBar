            <h4>History</h4>
            <p>
              AI in web3 is a fascinating intersection that envisions incorporating artifical intelligence
              technologies into decentralized web ecosystems, offering new possibilities and application. The history of web3 is still being written, but the potential goals include creating AI-driven decentralized application (dApps) that can interactwith blockchain networks, smart contracts, and other decentralized technologies. These AI applications could potentially enhance data privacy, security, and efficiency in web3 environments, as well as enable intelligent automation and decision making processes within decentralized systems.

            <h4>Vision</h4>
            <p>
               The visions of AI in web3 are diverse and promising. Some key visions include:
            </p>
            <p>
              Decentralized Autonomous Organisation (DAOs): AI can help facilitate the creation and management of DAOs, Autonomous entities that operate without centralized control. These DAOs can be AI algorithms to make decisions, optimize processes, and interact with other decentralized systems.
            </p>
            <p>
              Artifical Intelligent Marketplaces: AI in web3 can enables the creation of centralized marketplaces where AI algorithms can be bought, sold, and exchanged. This can foster innovation and collaboration among AI developers in a decentralized and trustless manner
            </p>
            <p>
              Smart Contracts and Automated Transations: AI can be integrated into smart contracts to enable more complex and dynamic automated transactions. This can streamline processes, reduce transation costs, and improve the overall efficiency of decentralized networks.
